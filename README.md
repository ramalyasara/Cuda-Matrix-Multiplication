# Cuda-Matrix-Multiplication
It will generate global thread and shared memory thread and generate graphs. 

First run the run.sh file
Then it need to input four matrix sizes 
In there it need to add 4 matrix sizes {example: 128 256 512 1024} If we changed matrix size the global thread is constant and value is 256 and shared memory threds per block is constant and value is 64
After it need to insert four thread sizes
In there it need to add 4 thread sizes {example: 128 256 512 1024} If we changed threads the matrix size is constant and value is 1024
After finishing running the run.sh file 
It will create a output pdf file called "Report.pdf" in Output folder
